# Drone Flight Controller
This repository contains the code and resources for an open-source drone flight controller project built with C++ and optimized for AVR processors such as the ATmega2560. It utilizes the onboard IMU (Gyroscope) BNO085 and an NRF24L01 radio for communication.

# Overview
The aim of this project is to create a simple yet effective flight controller for drones. The focus is on simplicity and functionality, ensuring that the complexity of drone control is minimized without compromising performance.

# Features
* C++ Implementation: High-performance code written in C++.
* AVR Processor Optimization: Designed specifically for ATmega2560.
* BNO085 Sensor Integration: Accurate orientation and motion tracking.
* NRF24L01 Radio: Reliable communication module.
# Vision
My vision is to create simple solutions because things don’t need to be harder than they need to be.
